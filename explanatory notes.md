# Data Structures and Algorithms —explanatory Notes

## Data Structure Classification

### Primitive Data Structures
- Integer
- Float
- Boolean
- Character
Used for storing basic values directly supported by programming languages.

---

## Non-Primitive Data Structures

### Linear Structures
Arrays — used in image pixels, tables, score lists  
Reason: Fast index access

Linked Lists — used in playlists and browser history  
Reason: Easy insertion and deletion

Stacks — used in undo operations and function calls  
Reason: Last-In-First-Out behavior

Queues — used in printer queues and scheduling  
Reason: First-In-First-Out fairness

---

### Non-Linear Structures

Trees — used in file systems and database indexing  
Reason: Hierarchical organization and fast search

Graphs — used in maps and social networks  
Reason: Relationship modeling

## Applications Using Data Structures and Algorithms

Operating Systems
- Process scheduling uses queues
- Function calls use stacks
- File systems use trees

Databases
- Indexing uses tree structures
- Fast lookup uses hashing

Navigation Systems
- Graphs + shortest path algorithms

Compilers
- Syntax trees
- Parsing stacks

## How They Work in Systems

Data structures organize data in memory efficiently.
Algorithms operate on those structures to:
- Search
- Sort
- Insert
- Delete
- Optimize performance

Together they determine:
- Speed
- Memory usage
- Scalability
- Reliability
